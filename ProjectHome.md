NWiki/DFWiki is a project conceived and leaded by Ludo (Marc Alier) in the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya to build a new wiki wiki module for Moodle.
It started on Feb 2005 and still goes on now.

This alternative Wiki module (called also new wiki or NWiki) is the evolution of DFWiki to fit in Moodle 1.6/1.7/1.8./1.9/2.0 replacing the standard wiki module.
The Moodle roadmap places NWiki as the official Wiki module for Moodle 2.0.

All the NWiki/DFWiki development has been done within the frame of degree
projects in the Computer Science Engineering studies in the FIB school
(http://www.fib.upc.edu) of the UPC University (http://www.upc.edu) in
Barcelona, Spain.

The main developers that have worked in this project are:
**Ferran Recio** David Castro
**Jordi Piguillem Poch**


And a growing number of students that contributes to this project.

NWiki/DFWiki has the same license as Moodle, that is, the GNU GPL v2 license.
